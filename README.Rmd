# r-manuals

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This project translates the [official R manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) to [quarto](https://quarto.org/) with the aim of lightly re-styling for better readability:

-   Separate the manual into page for each chapter
-   Code highlighting and formatting
-   Footnotes in sidebar
-   Improved searching

You can view the resulting [https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-intro/)

## How this works

Background information

-   Every hour the R source code (at SVN) gets copied to github, into the repo <https://github.com/wch/r-source>.
-   The manuals are in the folder <https://github.com/wch/r-source/tree/trunk/doc/manual>
-   Each manual is in file of format `texinfo`, the "GNU documentation format" (<https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>)
-   Since it is possible to render a `texinfo` document to HTML
-   Once in HTML format, you can use `pandoc` to convert the HTML to markdown, manipulate the markdown and then re-convert to HTML

## In more detail

For each manual:

-   Download the relevant `texinfo` manual files and associated images and environment variables
-   Run `makeinfo` to convert from `.texi` to HTML
-   Run `pandoc` with additional [Lua filters](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html) to convert to markdown
-   Perform additional processing and conversion in R
-   Include the markdown files in a quarto book template
-   Render the manual to quarto

Then combine the various quarto books into a quarto website

## Note about installing `makeinfo`

On Linux, you can easily install the `makeinfo` utility using `sudo apt install texinfo`

On Windows, `makeinfo` is installed as part of [RTools40](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40.html).
